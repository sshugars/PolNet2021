                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, thank You for giving us another day.
  Numbers of infections and hospitalizations are again spiking in 
various sectors of our Nation as we continue to consider social 
concerns about peace and justice in our communities.
  As it is a time of high feeling and reaction, we ask Your blessing of 
peace, patience, and good discernment in the days and weeks to come.
  Opinions and positions of interested parties are heightened. Calm our 
passions, that those responsible for molding a future in the wake of 
such monumental shifts in our sense of what is normal or usual are 
taking place.
  We thank You that we, as Americans, have faced such challenges in the 
past. Help us to have faith in You, and confidence in our 
constitutional way of proceeding, that we have good cause to have hope 
in what is to come.
  Bless us all this day, and every day, and may all that we do be for 
Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.

                   PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY MATERIAL


STATUS REPORT ON CURRENT LEVELS OF ON-BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR 
                                FY 2020

                                         House of Representatives,


                                      Committee on the Budget,

                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2020.
       Dear Madam Speaker: To facilitate application of sections 
     302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I am 
     transmitting an updated status report on the current levels 
     of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal year 2020. This 
     status report is current through June 5, 2020. The term 
     ``current level'' refers to the amounts of spending and 
     revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted 
     or awaiting the President's signature.
       Table 1 compares the current levels of total budget 
     authority, outlays, and revenues to the overall limits filed 
     in the Congressional Record on May 3, 2019, as adjusted, for 
     fiscal year 2020. These comparisons are needed to implement 
     section 311(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which 
     establishes a rule enforceable with a point of order against 
     measures that would breach the budget resolution's aggregate 
     levels.
       Table 2 compares the current status of discretionary 
     appropriations for fiscal year 2020 with the section 302(b) 
     suballocations of discretionary budget authority and outlays 
     among Appropriations subcommittees. The comparison is needed 
     to enforce section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 
     1974 because the point of order under that section equally 
     applies to measures that would breach the applicable section 
     302(b) suballocation. The table also provides supplementary 
     information on spending authorized in excess of the base 
     discretionary spending limits under section 251(b) of the 
     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.
       Table 3 compares the current levels of budget authority and 
     outlays for legislative action completed by each authorizing 
     committee with the limits filed in the Congressional Record 
     on May 3, 2019, for fiscal year 2020. These comparisons are 
     needed to enforce the point of order under section 302(f) of 
     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which prohibits the 
     consideration of measures that would breach the section 
     302(a) allocation of new budget authority for the committee 
     that reported the measure. It is also needed to implement 
     section 311(c), which provides an exception for committees 
     that comply with their allocations from the point of order 
     under section 311(a).
       Table 4 displays the current level of advance 
     appropriations in fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills. This 
     table is needed to enforce a rule against appropriations 
     bills containing advance appropriations that: (i) are not 
     identified in the statement of the Chairman published in the 
     Congressional Record on May 3, 2019 or (ii) would cause the 
     aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level 
     specified in section 2 of H. Res. 293.
       In addition, a letter from the Congressional Budget Office 
     is attached that summarizes and compares the budget impact 
     oflegislation enacted after May 3, 2019 against the budget 
     aggregate in force.
       If you have any questions, please contact Jennifer Wheelock 
     or Raquel Spencer.
           Sincerely,
                                                     John Yarmuth,
                                                         Chairman.

a Sections 1001-1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) require that certain funding provided for 2017
  through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services--in particular the Food and Drug Administration
  and the National Institutes of Health--be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and
  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment
  Control Act of 1974 (Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include
  $567 million in budget authority and $798 million in estimated outlays.
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the House, H. Res. 293, which
  established budget enforcement procedures in the House of Representatives for 2020, does not include budget
  authority, outlays. or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in this current level report do
  not include those items.
c In the House of Representatives, and pursuant to section 314(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974,
  amounts designated as an emergency requirement shall not count for purposes of title III and title IV of the
  Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and are excluded from current level totals. In addition, emergency funding
  that was not designated pursuant to the Deficit Control Act does not count for certain budgetary enforcement
  purposes. Those amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:

STATUS REPORT ON CURRENT LEVELS OF ON-BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR 
                                FY 2021

                                         House of Representatives,


                                      Committee on the Budget,

                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2020.
       Dear Madam Speaker: To facilitate application of sections 
     302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I am 
     transmitting an updated status report on the current levels 
     of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal year 2021. This 
     status report is current through June 5, 2020. The term 
     ``current level'' refers to the amounts of spending and 
     revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted 
     or awaiting the President's signature.
       Table 1 compares the current levels of total budget 
     authority, outlays, and revenues to the overall limits filed 
     in the Congressional Record on May 1, 2020 for fiscal year 
     2021 and for the 10-year period of fiscal years 2021 through 
     2030. These comparisons are needed to implement section 
     311(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which 
     establishes a rule enforceable with a point of order against 
     measures that would breach the budget resolution's aggregate 
     levels. The table does not show budget authority and outlays 
     for fiscal years 2022 through 2030 because annual 
     appropriations will not be considered for those years until 
     future sessions of Congress.
       Table 2 shows the current status of discretionary 
     appropriations for fiscal year 2021, which will be compared 
     with the section 302(b) suballocations of discretionary 
     budget authority and outlays among Appropriations 
     subcommittees. The comparison is needed to enforce section 
     302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 because the 
     point of order

[[Page H2383]]

     under that section equally applies to measures that would 
     breach the applicable section 302(b) suballocation.
       Table 3 compares the current levels of budget authority and 
     outlays for legislative action completed by each authorizing 
     committee with the limits filed in the Congressional Record 
     on May 1, 2020, for fiscal year 2021, and for the 10-year 
     period of fiscal years 2021 through 2030. These comparisons 
     are needed to enforce the point of order under section 302(f) 
     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which prohibits the 
     consideration of measures that would breach the section 
     302(a) allocation of new budget authority for the committee 
     that reported the measure. It is also needed to implement 
     section 311(c), which provides an exception for committees 
     that comply with their allocations from the point of order 
     under section 311(a).
       In addition, a letter from the Congressional Budget Office 
     is attached that summarizes the budget impact of legislation 
     enacted since May 1, 2020.

     or Raquel Spencer.
           Sincerely,
                                                     John Yarmuth,
                                                         Chairman.

                                  Congressional Budget Office,

                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2020.
     Hon. John Yarmuth,
     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, House of Representatives, 
         Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of 
     Congressional action on the fiscal year 2021 budget and is 
     current through June 5, 2020. This report is submitted under 
     section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional 
     Budget Act, as amended.
       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues 
     are consistent with the allocations, aggregates, and other 
     budgetary levels printed in the Congressional Record on May 
     1, 2020, pursuant to section 202 of the Bipartisan Budget Act 
     of 2019 (Public Law 116-37).
       This is CBO's first current level report for fiscal year 
     2021.
           Sincerely,
                                                Phillip L. Swagel.

n.a. = not applicable; P.L. = public law.
a Sections 1001-1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) require that certain funding provided for 2017
  through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services--in particular the Food and Drug Administration
  and the National Institutes of Health--be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and
  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and lmpoundment
  Control Act of 1974 (Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include
  $646 million in estimated prior outlays.
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the House, the aggregate spending and
  revenue levels for 2021 published in the Congressional Record on May 1, 2020, by the Chair of the House
  Committee on the Budget pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-37), do not include budget
  authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in this current level report do
  not include those items.
c In the House of Representatives, and pursuant to section 314(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974,
  amounts designated as an emergency requirement shall not count for purposes of title lll and title IV of the
  Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and are excluded from current level totals. In addition, emergency funding
  that was not designated pursuant to the Deficit Control Act does not count for certain budgetary enforcement
  purposes. Those amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:


 
                                           Budget authority             Outlays                  Revenues
 
Emergency Requirements:
    Paycheck Protection Program                              0                        0                   -8,091
     Flexibility Act of 2020 (P.L.
     116-142)........................
                                      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Total, Emergency Requirements                        0                        0                   -8,091
